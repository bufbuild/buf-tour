# Buf Tour

This repository is used in the Buf Tour described [here](https://docs.buf.build/tour/introduction).

The tour introduces you to the `buf` CLI and the Buf Schema Registry ([BSR](https://docs.buf.build/bsr/overview)).
Along the way, you will enforce lint standards, detect breaking changes, generate code, create a
[module](https://docs.buf.build/bsr/overview#module), manage a non-trivial dependency graph, and publish the module
to the BSR so that it can be consumed by others. The tour takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.
